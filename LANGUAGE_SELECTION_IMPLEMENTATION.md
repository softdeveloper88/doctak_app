# Language Selection Screen Implementation

## ✅ **Feature Complete**: First-Time Language Selection

A beautiful language selection screen has been implemented that shows after the splash screen for first-time users or when app cache is cleared.

### **🎯 Implementation Overview**

1. **Language Selection Screen Created** (`/lib/presentation/language_selection_screen/language_selection_screen.dart`)
   - Modern, animated UI with beautiful design
   - Supports 6 languages: English, Arabic, Persian/Farsi, French, Spanish, German
   - Flag icons and native language names
   - Smooth animations and transitions

2. **App Flow Integration**
   - Modified `unified_splash_upgrade_screen.dart` to check first-time status
   - Added navigation logic to show language screen when needed
   - Integrated with existing localization system

3. **Storage & Persistence**
