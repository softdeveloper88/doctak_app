# Fix for "You do not have required contracts to perform an operation"

## Solution Steps:

### 1. Sign Required Agreements in Apple Developer Portal

1. **Go to Apple Developer Portal**: https://developer.apple.com/account/
2. **Sign in** with your Apple Developer account
3. **Navigate to Agreements**:
   - Click on "Agreements, Tax, and Banking"
   - Look for any pending agreements that need to be signed
   - Common agreements required:
     - **Paid Apps Agreement** (required for App Store distribution)
     - **Free Apps Agreement** (required for free app distribution)
     - **iOS Developer Program License Agreement**

4. **Sign Pending Agreements**:
   - Click on any agreement with status "Action Required"
   - Read and accept the terms
   - Provide any required information (banking, tax, contact details)

### 2. Update App Store Connect Settings

1. **Go to App Store Connect**: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/
2. **Check App Store Connect Agreement**:

   - Ensure all agreements are "Active"
   - Sign any pending agreements

3. **Verify Banking Information**:
   - Add banking information if required
   - Complete tax information
   - Verify contact information

### 3. Wait for Processing (24-48 hours)

After signing agreements, Apple may take 24-48 hours to process them. During this time:
- Agreements may show as "Processing"
- You cannot upload apps until processing is complete
- Check back periodically for status updates

### 4. Alternative: Check Team Permissions

If you're part of a team:
1. **Verify Role**: Ensure you have "Admin" or "App Manager" role
2. **Contact Team Agent**: Ask the team agent to sign required agreements
3. **Check App Permissions**: Ensure you have upload permissions for the specific app

### 5. Verify Apple ID Settings

1. **Check Apple ID**: Ensure the Apple ID used in Xcode matches your developer account
2. **Update Xcode**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Xcode
3. **Clear Xcode Cache**: 
   - Quit Xcode
   - Delete `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
   - Restart Xcode

### Issue: "No Active Agreements"
