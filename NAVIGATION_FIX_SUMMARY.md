# Navigation Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The app was crashing when taking photos or videos from the camera with the error:
```
Null check operator used on a null value
Navigator.of (package:flutter/src/widgets/navigator.dart:2875:38)
```

## Root Cause
The bottom sheet context was being disposed before the camera operation completed, causing navigation failures.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Bottom Sheet Navigation Fix**
- Added proper context handling in `attachment_bottom_sheet.dart`
- Store navigator reference before closing bottom sheet
- Added small delay to ensure navigation completes
- Wrapped all operations in try-catch blocks

### 2. **Chat Room Navigation Fix**
- Used `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` to schedule navigation
- Added `mounted` checks to prevent navigation on disposed widgets
- Proper error handling throughout the flow

### 3. **MobX Observer Fix**
- Fixed observer warning by using `appStore.isCurrentlyOnNoInternet` instead of local variable

## Key Changes Made

1. **Camera Option**: Navigator stored before bottom sheet closes
2. **Video Option**: Same pattern with error handling
3. **Document Picker**: Consistent navigation handling
4. **Gallery Selection**: Added proper context management
5. **Chat Room**: PostFrameCallback for safe navigation

## Result
- No more navigation crashes
- Smooth camera/video capture flow
- Proper error handling throughout
- Clean MobX observer warnings
