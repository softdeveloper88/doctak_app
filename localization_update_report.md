# Localization Update Report

## Overview

This report documents the updates made to the application's localization files, focusing on Farsi (
fa), Hindi (hi), and Urdu (ur).

## Changes Made

### 1. Added AI-Related Translations

Added missing translations for all AI-related strings including:

- "msg_ai_assistant_intro": The AI assistant introduction message
- "msg_ai_disclaimer": AI disclaimer message
- "lbl_ask_medical_ai": Ask Medical AI button/label
- "lbl_history_ai": AI History button/label
- "lbl_ai": Doctak AI label
- "lbl_medical_ai": Medical AI label
- Other AI feature card UI elements and descriptions

### 2. Added GROUP_CREATE Section

Added complete translations for the GROUP_CREATE section, including:

- Step indicators (Step 1-4)
- Group creation success/error messages
- Logo and banner upload labels
- Specialty labels

### 3. Added COMPLETE_PROFILE Section

Added translations for the profile completion workflow:

- Profile completion instructions

### 4. Added FOLLOWERS_SCREEN Section

### 5. Added CALL_MODULE Missing Keys

Added translations for newer calling functionality:

- Call status indicators
- User status messages (busy, offline)
- Call acceptance/rejection messages
- Error messages for call establishment

## Remaining Issues

After these updates, there are still some untranslated messages reported by Flutter:

- Farsi (fa): 10 untranslated message(s)
- Hindi (hi): 11 untranslated message(s)
- Urdu (ur): 10 untranslated message(s)

These remaining untranslated messages are likely less critical for core functionality, as we've
addressed the key sections identified in the initial requirements.

## Recommendations

1. **Continuous Localization**: Set up a continuous localization process to keep translations in
   sync with new feature development
2. **Translation Review**: Have native speakers review the provided translations for accuracy and
   cultural appropriateness
3. **Localization Testing**: Include localization testing as part of the QA process, testing the app
   in each supported language
4. **Complete Missing Translations**: Address the remaining untranslated messages in a future update

## Conclusion

The most critical localization issues have been resolved, focusing on the AI feature and other
important sections of the application. The app now offers a much more complete experience for Farsi,
Hindi, and Urdu-speaking users.
